## Small project to scrape food ordering service page

Only downloads restaurante names, ratings, and number of ratings.
Creates a pandas dataframe in order to help me find the most loved pizza in a given district.
Of course every pizza equally fantastic.
No delay or any extra setting since it only one page load initialized. No overload.
Always be nice when scraping.
